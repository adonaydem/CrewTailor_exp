        Users can tailor workflows according to their needs. They have the following options to create a workflow:
        1. Form
        2. Visualization
        3. Chat with PAM

        ## How to run a workflow
        User can only run a workflow manually.
        When a workflow runs, it will have steps, each handled by different ai agent. A workflow will additionally have an agent called manager.
        The manager will instruct and get info for you.

        The best practice is to tell user's needs to the manager, and he will automatically connect the user to the relevant team member.
        However, users can jump directly on to agents(Not recommended.)
